# Python simulator for RWA

## Requirements

We recommend the use of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

```bash
$ conda create --name rwa python=3.7
$ conda activate rwa
$ conda install numpy matplotlib
$ conda install -c anaconda networkx
```

However if you can of course use pip as well

```bash
$ pip3 install pip --upgrade
$ pip3 install numpy matplotlib networkx
```

or simple use the `requirements.txt` file

```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

Just type `python3 sim_rwa.py` and watch as the things roll.
