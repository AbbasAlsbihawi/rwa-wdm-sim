## Routing and Wavelength Assignment Simulator
[Paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-65340-2_35): 
A Genetic Algorithm (GA) Approach for Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) in
All-Optical Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) Networks with Static Traffic
(SLE, which stands for _Static Lightpath Establishment_)

This repo basically basically contains a simulator that covers the routing and
wavelength assignment problem with the following algorithms:

* Routing 
    * Dijkstra's algorithm  
    * Yen's algorithm (also known as K-shortest path algorithm)  

* Wavelength Assignment
    * First-fit algorithm  
    * Vertex coloring algorithm  

* RWA as one   
     * General Objective Function  
     * Genetic algorithm (ours :)
